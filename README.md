# About this Project

This site was made with inspiration from the project developed by @overizando to be used in the paranormal RPG, this site was one of the first projects I tried to make while learning HTML CSS and JavaScript, I decided to redo it because now I have more knowledge in programming, but it's not fully finished yet, because there are many things I still want to insert.

This Project was used 
`React.Js` 
`TailwindCSS`
  and
`Firebase`
